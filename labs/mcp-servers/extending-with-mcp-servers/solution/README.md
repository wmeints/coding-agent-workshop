# Lab: Extending the application with MCP server support - Solution

This directory contains the solution code for the lab on extending your coding agent
with MCP server support.

## Solution Overview

This solution demonstrates:

- Complete configuration model implementation
- MCP client manager with error handling
- Proper resource cleanup and disposal
- Integration with the main agent application

## Key Components

- `Configuration/McpServerConfig.cs` - Configuration model for individual servers
- `Configuration/McpConfiguration.cs` - Overall configuration with file loading
- `McpClientManager.cs` - Manages connections to all configured MCP servers
- Updated agent initialization code to load and use MCP configuration

## Running the Solution

1. Create a `.agent/mcp.json` file in your workspace
2. Configure one or more MCP servers
3. Run the agent and observe the connection logs
4. Verify clean shutdown when the agent exits

Refer to the [lab guide](../../../../src/content/docs/modules/mcp-servers/extending-with-mcp-servers.mdx)
for detailed explanations of the implementation.
