In this section we'll introduce Semantic Kernel and how it helps you build 
LLM-based applications. We'll cover why it exists, the key concepts, and how to
get started using it in your .NET applications.

## Why Was Semantic Kernel Invented?

Semantic Kernel is a lightweight, open-source development kit created by 
Microsoft to address the challenges of integrating LLM capabilities into 
enterprise applications. It was designed to serve as efficient middleware that 
enables rapid delivery of enterprise-grade AI solutions.

The library was born from several key needs:

- **Automating Business Processes**: Organizations needed a way to combine AI 
  prompts with existing APIs to perform automated actions. Semantic Kernel acts 
  as the middleware that translates AI model requests into function calls and
  passes results back to the model.

- **Future-Proofing AI Integrations**: As AI models evolve rapidly, companies
  needed a solution that would allow them to swap out models without rewriting
  their entire codebase. Semantic Kernel provides this flexibility by
  abstracting the AI service layer.

- **Enterprise Readiness**: Microsoft and Fortune 500 companies required a
  solution that was flexible, modular, and observable, with security-enhancing
  capabilities like telemetry support, hooks, and filters for responsible AI at
  scale.

## Key Concepts

### The Kernel

The kernel is the central orchestration component in Semantic Kernel. It serves
as a container that manages:

- **AI Services**: Chat completion, text generation, embeddings, and other AI capabilities
- **Plugins**: Your custom functions and integrations that the AI can call
- **Memory**: Conversation history and context storage
- **Configuration**: Logging, telemetry, and other enterprise services

Think of the kernel as the "brain" that coordinates between AI models and your
application code, enabling the AI to understand what functions are available and
when to call them.

We'll use the Kernel component extensively in the agent code. As we build out
the coding agent, we'll also explore plugins and memory and to a lesser extent
the observability and other enterprise features.

### Multi-Provider Support

Semantic Kernel supports multiple AI providers out of the box, allowing you to:

- Use **Azure OpenAI**, **OpenAI**, or other compatible services
- Switch between providers without changing your application logic
- Work with different models for different tasks
- Easily adapt as new AI models and services are released

This provider-agnostic approach means you're not locked into a single vendor 
and can take advantage of the latest AI capabilities as they become available.

For the workshop we'll use Azure AI Foundry services, but you can use your own
OpenAI or Azure OpenAI keys if you prefer.

### Extensibility Through Plugins

Plugins are the mechanism through which AI agents can interact with your code
and external systems. Plugins are often implemented as C# classses with methods
that implement tools the agent can use.

You're not required to build your own plugins. You can also connect to existing
tools using MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. We'll cover MCP in more detail
in the final module of the workshop.

## Installing Semantic Kernel in .NET

Getting started with Semantic Kernel in a .NET application is straightforward:

### 1. Install the NuGet Package

The primary package you need for most scenarios is `Microsoft.SemanticKernel`:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.SemanticKernel
```

This package includes support for connecting to Azure OpenAI and OpenAI services.
You can also add support for other provideers:

| Provider         | Package Name                                    |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI           | Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.OpenAI      |
| Azure OpenAI     | Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.AzureOpenAI |
| Ollama           | Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.Ollama      |
| Hugging Face     | Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.HuggingFace |
| Google           | Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.Google      |
| Anthropic/Amazon | Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.Amazon      |

### 3. Create and Configure the Kernel

Here's a minimal example to get you started:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;

// Create a kernel builder
var builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();

// Add an AI service (example with Azure OpenAI)
builder.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(
    deploymentName: "your-model-id",
    endpoint: "your-endpoint",
    apiKey: "your-api-key"
);

// Add logging for debugging
builder.Services.AddLogging(services => 
    services.AddConsole().SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Trace));

// Build the kernel
Kernel kernel = builder.Build();
```

### 4. Start Using the Kernel

Once configured, you can retrieve services from the kernel and start building AI-powered features:

```csharp
var chatService = kernel.GetRequiredService<IChatCompletionService>();

// Start using the AI agent
var history = new ChatHistory();
history.AddUserMessage("Hello!");

// Generate a response
var response = await chatService.GetChatMessageContentAsync(
    history, 
    kernel: kernel
);
```

That's all you need to start building AI agents with Semantic Kernel in your .NET applications!
