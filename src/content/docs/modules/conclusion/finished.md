Thank you for completing this workshop! You've built a functional coding agent with Semantic Kernel and learned the fundamentals of agent development. You now have a solid foundation to continue building and improving your agent.

## Ideas for Expanding Your Agent

Your agent is functional, but there are many ways to make it even more powerful and useful. Here are some ideas to explore:

### Custom Prompts

Add support for custom prompts to give users more control over how the agent behaves:

- Allow users to define custom system prompts for specific tasks
- Create prompt templates that users can select from
- Enable users to override the default agent behavior with their own instructions

This gives your agent more flexibility and allows it to adapt to different use cases and preferences.

### Glob-Based Custom Instructions

Expand your custom instructions feature to support file-specific guidance:

- Add support for glob patterns (e.g., `*.test.cs`, `src/api/**/*.cs`)
- Let users define different instructions for different parts of their codebase
- Allow inheritance of instructions from broader to more specific patterns

For example, you could have one set of instructions for all C# files, and more specific instructions for test files or API controllers.

### Tool Permission System

Improve the security and control of your agent by implementing a permission system:

- Ask for user confirmation before executing potentially dangerous operations
- Create a whitelist/blacklist system for allowed commands
- Implement different permission levels for different types of tools
- Add the ability to review and approve changes before they're applied

This is especially important for operations that modify files, execute system commands, or interact with external services.

## Continue Building

These are just starting pointsâ€”the possibilities for expanding your agent are endless. Consider what would make your agent most useful for your specific workflow and start experimenting!
