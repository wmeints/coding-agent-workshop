title: Testing the agent application
description: This tutorial explains how you can test the agent loop with unit-tests and what other considerations you should have in mind when testing.

In this section we'll build a set of unit-tests and an integration test for the
agent loop we created in the previous sections. Testing is an important part of
building reliable agents and not always as straightforward as testing traditional
applications.
