Welcome to the task memory module! In this module, you'll learn how to enhance
your coding agent's capabilities through context engineering. By the end of
this module you'll know:

- How context engineering improves agent performance and reliability
- How to provide custom instructions to the agent using AGENTS.md
- How to implement task memory with TODO items to help agents adhere to plans
- How to test custom instructions and task memory components

## What is context engineering?

Context engineering is the practice of providing structured information to an
LLM to improve its decision-making and task execution. While tools extend what
an agent *can* do, context engineering improves *how well* it does those things.

There are two main types of context we can provide:

1. **Custom Instructions**: Static guidance that shapes the agent's overall behavior
2. **Task Memory**: Dynamic state that helps the agent track progress and maintain focus

Together, these techniques dramatically improve an agent's ability to complete
complex, multi-step tasks.

## Custom instructions with AGENTS.md

Custom instructions allow users to personalize their agent's behavior. By
reading an `AGENTS.md` file from the working directory, we can provide the
agent with:

- Preferred coding styles and conventions
- Project-specific guidelines
- Domain knowledge about the codebase
- User preferences for communication style

This approach is inspired by tools like Claude Code and Cursor, which use
similar conventions to allow users to customize agent behavior per-project.

## Task memory and TODO tracking

One of the biggest challenges with LLM-based agents is keeping them focused on
multi-step plans. Task memory helps solve this by:

- Breaking complex tasks into discrete TODO items
- Tracking completion status of each step
- Providing the agent with a clear view of what's done and what remains
- Reducing the chance of the agent forgetting or skipping steps

We'll implement a `TaskMemoryPlugin` that allows the agent to:
- Create TODO lists for complex tasks
- Mark items as in-progress or completed
- Query the current state of the TODO list

## Architecture integration

The components we'll build in this module integrate directly with the `CodingAgent` class:

- `AgentInstructions`: Reads and parses AGENTS.md files
- `TaskMemoryPlugin`: Manages TODO items and provides task memory tools

## What we'll build in this module

We'll implement context engineering through three focused labs:

1. [Implement custom instructions with AGENTS.md](/modules/task-memory/custom-instructions)
2. [Build the task memory plugin](/modules/task-memory/task-memory-plugin)
3. [Test custom instructions and task memory](/modules/task-memory/testing)

Let's start by implementing custom instructions!
