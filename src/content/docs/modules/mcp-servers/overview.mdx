In this module, we'll learn how to extend the coding agent with MCP servers to
provide additional capabilities and context. By the end of the module you'll know:

- What the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is and what value it brings to coding agents
- Security considerations when using MCP servers
- What the basic structure of an MCP server in .NET looks like
- How to integrate MCP servers into your agent application

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol designed to facilitate
communication between AI models and external services. It provides a structured way
to exchange context, data, and capabilities between your agent and specialized servers.

Think of MCP servers as plugins that extend your agent's capabilities beyond what
you build directly into your application. Instead of implementing every tool yourself,
you can leverage MCP servers built by others or create specialized servers for
specific domains.

### Value for coding agents

MCP servers bring several key benefits to coding agents:

**Modularity and reusability:** Instead of building every capability into your main
agent, you can distribute functionality across multiple MCP servers. This makes your
agent more maintainable and allows you to reuse servers across different projects.

**Specialized capabilities:** MCP servers can provide deep integration with specific
tools, platforms, or data sources. For example, an MCP server could provide specialized
access to GitHub APIs, Azure DevOps, or a company's internal systems.

**Community ecosystem:** The MCP protocol is becoming a standard, which means you can
leverage servers built by the community. This accelerates development and allows you
to focus on your agent's core logic rather than reimplementing integrations.

**Dynamic tool discovery:** MCP servers expose their capabilities through a standard
interface. Your agent can discover available tools at runtime and make them available
to the LLM without hardcoding each integration.

### How MCP works with your agent

When your agent connects to an MCP server, it can:

1. **Discover available tools** - The server advertises what tools it provides
2. **Execute tools** - The agent can call these tools and receive structured responses
3. **Access resources** - Some servers provide access to data or context
4. **Handle prompts** - Servers can provide specialized prompts for specific tasks

The agent acts as an MCP client, maintaining connections to one or more MCP servers
throughout its lifecycle. When the LLM decides to use a tool provided by an MCP
server, your agent orchestrates the communication between the LLM and the server.

## Security considerations

When working with MCP servers, security is paramount. Here are key considerations:

**Trust boundaries:** MCP servers run as separate processes and can execute arbitrary
code. Only use MCP servers from trusted sources, and review the code if possible
before deploying them.

**Sandboxing:** Consider running MCP servers in isolated environments or containers
to limit the potential damage if a server is compromised or misbehaves.

**Configuration security:** MCP servers often require configuration like API keys,
connection strings, or credentials. Store these securely and never commit them to
version control. Use environment variables or secure configuration stores.

**Input validation:** Even though MCP is a structured protocol, always validate
inputs and outputs. Don't assume that a server will always return well-formed data.

**Network security:** If MCP servers communicate over the network, ensure connections
are encrypted and authenticated. The MCP protocol supports both local stdio-based
communication and remote connections.

**User permissions:** Consider what permissions your agent should have when calling
MCP servers. Not all users should have access to all servers or all tools within
a server.

<Card title="Security Best Practices">
Always review MCP server configurations and only enable servers that are necessary
for your use case. Start with minimal permissions and add more as needed.

## Basic structure of an MCP server in .NET

While we won't build an MCP server in this workshop, it's helpful to understand
the basic structure. This knowledge helps you understand how to configure and
integrate servers effectively.

### Core components

An MCP server in .NET typically consists of:

**Server implementation:** A class that implements the MCP server protocol. The
official C# SDK provides base classes that handle protocol details.

```csharp
using ModelContextProtocol.Server;

public class MyMcpServer : McpServer
{
    public MyMcpServer() : base("my-server", "1.0.0")
    {
    }
}
```

**Tool definitions:** Tools are defined as methods with attributes describing their
purpose and parameters. This is similar to how you define Semantic Kernel plugins.

```csharp
[McpTool("search_documentation")]
[Description("Searches product documentation for relevant information")]
public async Task<ToolResult> SearchDocumentation(
    [Description("The search query")] string query)
{
    // Implementation here
    return new ToolResult { Content = "Search results..." };
}
```

**Resource providers:** Some servers expose resources (like files or data) that the
agent can access.

**Transport layer:** MCP servers can communicate via stdio (standard input/output) or
over network protocols. The stdio approach is common for locally installed servers.

### Server lifecycle

1. **Initialization:** The server starts and initializes its capabilities
2. **Capability negotiation:** The client (your agent) connects and discovers available tools
3. **Tool execution:** The agent sends requests to execute tools as needed
4. **Shutdown:** The server cleanly shuts down when the client disconnects

## What we'll build in this module

In the next sections, we'll extend your coding agent to support MCP servers:

1. [Extending the application with MCP server support](/modules/mcp-servers/extending-with-mcp-servers) -
   Configure your agent to load and connect to MCP servers via a configuration file.
2. [Integrating MCP servers in the agent loop](/modules/mcp-servers/integrating-mcp-servers) -
   Update the core agent loop to discover and use tools from MCP servers.

Let's get started by adding MCP server support to the application!
