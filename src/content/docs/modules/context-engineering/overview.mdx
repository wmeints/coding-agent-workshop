Welcome to the task memory module! In this module, you'll learn how to enhance
your coding agent's capabilities through context engineering. By the end of
this module you'll know:

- How context engineering improves agent performance and reliability
- How to provide custom instructions to the agent using AGENTS.md
- How to implement task memory with TODO items to help agents adhere to plans
- How to test custom instructions and task memory components

## What is context engineering?

Context engineering is the practice of providing structured information to an
LLM to improve its decision-making and task execution. While tools extend what
an agent *can* do, context engineering improves *how well* it does those things.

There are two main types of context we can provide:

1. **Custom Instructions**: Static guidance that shapes the agent's overall
   behavior. These instructions change, but much slower than task specific data.
2. **Task Memory**: Dynamic state that helps the agent track progress and
   maintain focus. The task memory varies per task and evolves as the agent
   works. The task memory is formed from the prompt you enter when starting a 
   new task.

Together, these techniques dramatically improve an agent's ability to complete
complex, multi-step tasks. The more context we provide, the better the agent can
establish a coding pattern to follow. I can tell you from personal experience
that adding context engineering to an agent makes a huge difference, you can
build bigger features with fewer mistakes and less back-and-forth.

### Custom instructions with AGENTS.md

Custom instructions allow users to personalize their agent's behavior by
describing the key technologies and preferences for their project. By using an
`AGENTS.md` file from the working directory, we can provide the agent with:

- Preferred coding styles and conventions
- Project-specific guidelines
- Domain knowledge about the codebase
- User preferences for communication style

This approach is inspired by tools like Claude Code, Github Copilot, and Cursor
which use similar conventions to allow users to customize agent behavior
per-project.

### Task memory and TODO tracking

One of the biggest challenges with LLM-based agents is keeping them focused on
multi-step plans. Often, the agent forgets what it is working on because the
context window of the LLM is somewhat forgetful when the content gets longer.

Task memory helps solve this by:

- Breaking complex tasks into discrete TODO items
- Tracking completion status of each step
- Providing the agent with a clear view of what's done and what remains
- Reducing the chance of the agent forgetting or skipping steps

We can modify the agent's instructions to help it use task memory effectively to
stay on track with the plan.

We'll implement a `TaskMemoryPlugin` that allows the agent to:

- Create TODO lists for complex tasks
- Mark items as in-progress or completed
- Query the current state of the TODO list

## Architecture integration

The components we'll build in this module integrate directly with the `CodingAgent` class:

- `AgentInstructions`: Reads and parses AGENTS.md files
- `TaskMemoryPlugin`: Manages TODO items and provides task memory tools

## What we'll build in this module

We'll implement context engineering through two focused labs:

1. [Implement custom instructions with AGENTS.md](/modules/task-memory/custom-instructions)
2. [Build the task memory plugin](/modules/task-memory/task-memory-plugin)

Let's start by implementing custom instructions!
