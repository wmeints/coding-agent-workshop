title: Building the Text Editor Plugin
description: This tutorial teaches you how to build a Text Editor Plugin for the coding agent.
---

In this lab, we'll add a text editor plugin to our coding agent. If you've used
the agent from the previous lab (which you should totally do, because it works!),
you'll notice that it edits files using a rather unlikely toolset. For example,
on Linux it will use sed/cat/echo and other tools to manipulate files. While it
works, it's not very pretty to see.

A better approach is to add a text editor plugin that provides tools to view
and edit files directly. This is what we'll do in this lab.

We'll need to create several tools:

- The `view_file` tool to view the contents of a file. This tool can show fragments, as well as full file contents.
- The `write_file` tool to write contents to a file, replacing any existing content or creating new files.
- The `insert_text` tool to insert text at a specific line in a file.
- The `replace_text` tool to replace text in a file between specific line numbers.

Let's get started building the plugin class first.

## Create the TextEditorPlugin class

[Add instructions how to create the TextEditorPlugin class. Include instructions
to add the plugin to the kernel in the Agent class.]

## Add view_file tool

[Add instructions on how to add the view_file tool.]

## Add the write_file tool

[Add instructions on how to add the write_file tool.]

## Add the insert_text tool

[Add instructions on how to add the insert_text tool.]

## Add the replace_text tool

[Add instructions on how to add the replace_text tool.]

## Summary

[Add a summary of the lab with the operations with performed. Refer to the
solution files as needed.]
