In this workshop we cover most of the basics needed to build your own
coding agent. The workshop contains 4 modules that will help you build the
various pieces of your coding agent.

## Workshop modules

This workshop covers the following topics:

1. **Introduction:** Helps you set up your development environment and teaches
   some fundamentals about working with LLMs and Semantic Kernel. By the end
   of this module you'll know enough to start building an agent.

2. **The core agent loop:** Teaches you about the core agent loop and how to
   configure a basic agent in Semantic Kernel in your application. By the end of
   this module, you'll have a working terminal interface and an agent to talk
   to and you'll understand how to build and extend the agent loop.

3. **Agent tools:** Explains what tools are, how to build and test tools in
   Semantic Kernel and how to use tools in your agent. By the end of the module
   your agent can read and write code and you'll know how this works.

4. **Task memory:** In this final module, you'll learn why agents sometimes don't
   do the things you expect them to do. You'll also learn how to help your agent
   by providing short-term task memory so it can create and update its own plan.
