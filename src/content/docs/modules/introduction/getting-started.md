description: Start the workshop from here

Welcome to the workshop! Today you'll learn how to build a coding agent with C#
and Semantic Kernel. By the end of the workshop you'll have a working agent
you can use on our own code!

My ultimate goal is to help you understand what agents are and how they work. 
Agents are useful in a lot of places, but I figured that since you're a developer
that it would make the most sense to learn how to build one you can use for
coding tasks.

Before we start with the workshop, review the system requirements below and make
sure you have the code and necessary tools to get started.

## System requirements

You'll need the following software on your computer:

- Windows, Mac, or Linux
- [Podman](https://podman.io) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dot.net)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

## Download the sources

Make sure you download the sources for the repository. Execute the following
command on your computer to get the sources for the workshop:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wmeints/coding-agent-workshop
```

## Access to the LLM

You will need access to a Large Language Model to complete the workshop.
We'll provide you with the necessary settings. They should be displayed on the
big screen and you can get a copy of the information by e-mail. Make sure to
ask the trainer for access.
