title: Providing feedback
description: How to provide feedback and ask questions
---

You can complete the workshop during the event or later at your own pace. During
the event I can help you fix issues or answer your questions. This is a lot
harder for me when you work from home. Here's how to get help.

## Report issues

Please help your fellow workshop attendees by reporting issues on Github.
You can report issues by going here: https://github.com/wmeints/coding-agent-workshop/issues/.

## Ask questions

During the event you can ask me questions and I'll try to help as much as I can.
After the workshop it's easier to start a new discussion on Github: https://github.com/wmeints/coding-agent-workshop/discussions/.
