# Foundation

Understanding agents and Semantic Kernel

---

## What We'll Learn

- What AI agents are and how they work
- Introduction to Semantic Kernel
- Key concepts for building agents
- Setting up your development environment

---

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a system that can:

- **Perceive** its environment
- **Reason** about what to do
- **Act** to achieve goals
- **Learn** from feedback

## Agents vs. Chatbots

| Chatbot | Agent |
|---------|-------|
| Responds to queries | Takes autonomous action |
| Single-turn interactions | Multi-step task execution |
| No tools | Uses tools to interact |
| Stateless | Maintains context |

## Semantic Kernel

A powerful SDK for building AI applications

Key features:
- **Plugin system** for extending capabilities
- **Prompt management** for LLM interactions
- **Memory services** for context
- **Connectors** for various AI providers

---

## Core Concepts

- **Kernel**: The central orchestrator
- **Plugins**: Collections of functions
- **Functions**: Individual capabilities
- **Connectors**: AI service integrations
