# Build a coding agent in a day with Semantic Kernel and C#

## Goal for the workshop

In this workshop you'll learn how to use Semantic Kernel to build a coding
agent. By the end of this workshop you know the inner workings of coding agents
as well as how to build effective LLM-based applications in C#.

## Target audience

This workshop is meant for C# developers. There is no need to understand 
how LLMs work ahead of time. I'll explain in the workshop.

## Table of contents 

- **Module 1: Setup and introduction:** In the first module we'll explore LLMs
  and how to create the project structure for the coding agent.

- **Building the core of the coding agent:** In this module we'll look at
  core agent loop and the base instructions for the agent.

- **Giving the agent tools to work with:** This module covers how to build the
  necessary plugins and tools for the agent to be able to edit code.

- **Adding task memory:** In this module we'll look at adding task memory and
  how to get debugging information from the agent using opentelemetry.

- **Including support for MCP servers:** In the final module, we'll look at
  using MCP servers to extend the functionality of the coding agent.

## Structure of the modules

Each module features a short presentation explaining the concepts before you
start building code in the lab. The slides are included in the website so you
can review them on your own pace.

I've included a completed sample for each of the modules so you can skip ahead
if you get stuck on a module.

## Contributing to this workshop

As with all my personal workshops, this one's free and open source. I love
getting feedback and help fixing issues in the workshop. So if you find anything
