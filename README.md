## Goal for the workshop

In this workshop you'll learn how to use Semantic Kernel to build a coding
agent. By the end of this workshop you know the inner workings of coding agents
as well as how to build effective LLM-based applications in C#.

## Target audience

This workshop is meant for C# developers. There is no need to understand 
how LLMs work ahead of time. I'll explain in the workshop.

## Workshop contents

- **Module 1: Setup and introduction:** In the first module we'll explore LLMs
  and how to create the project structure for the coding agent.

- **Building the core of the coding agent:** In this module we'll look at
  core agent loop and the base instructions for the agent.

- **Giving the agent tools to work with:** This module covers how to build the
  necessary plugins and tools for the agent to be able to edit code.

- **Adding task memory:** In this module we'll look at adding task memory and
  how to get debugging information from the agent using opentelemetry.

- **Including support for MCP servers:** In the final module, we'll look at
  using MCP servers to extend the functionality of the coding agent.

## Contributing to this workshop
