# Build a coding agent in a day with Semantic Kernel and C#

## Goal for the workshop

In this workshop you'll learn how to use Semantic Kernel to build a coding
agent. By the end of this workshop you know the inner workings of coding agents
as well as how to build effective LLM-based applications in C#.

## Target audience

This workshop is meant for C# developers. There is no need to understand 
how LLMs work ahead of time. I'll explain in the workshop.

## Table of contents 

- **Building the core of the coding agent:** This module teaches you how to 
  setup a new project in Semantic Kernel and helps you set up the core loop
  for the agent.
- **Adding tools and testing the agent:** In this module you'll learn how to
  build tools for your agent and test the agent without interacting with the
  LLM.
- **Adding observability and TODO items:** This module teaches you how to make
  your agent more observable and how to add memory to allow the agent to solve
  more complex tasks.
- **Including support for long-term memory:** In the final module for the 
  workshop you'll learn how to add long-term memory to the agent.

## Bonus modules

Because this first edition of the workshop is only one day, I can't include
everything you'd need to build an agent. Consider the following two modules
a bonus to the core workshop that will take your agent to the next level.

- **Adding support for custom instructions and prompts:** The combination of
  custom instructions and custom prompts help your agent to better handle
  complex programming tasks without the need for lengthy user prompts. This
  module explains how to add both to the coding agent.
- **Adding support for MCP servers:** If you've managed to make custom
  instructions and prompts work, then you should definitely look at adding
  support for MCP servers. They add another layer of useful utilities to fix
  some of the short-comings of the more basic coding agent.

## Structure of the modules

The workshop starts with a theoretical piece in which I explain the concepts
we'll work on in the labs. The slides for each section are included in the
website for the workshop. 

After explaining the theory, you can try it out with real code in your own
copy of the coding agent. The website includes instructions and references
to the manual. The solution is also included in the workshop modules.

## Contributing to this workshop

As with all my personal workshops, this one's free and open source. I love
getting feedback and help fixing issues in the workshop. So if you find anything
missing or broken, please let me know.
